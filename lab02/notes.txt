DISCO:
0. ArrayList = ArrayList<Integer> will produce a warning saying that the code
   uses unsafe or unchecked operations because the first ArrayList is not
   necessarily an array of Integers. However, it's still allowed.
1. If you get the above warning, if you want more details (like what
   specifically caused the warning) you can enter javac -Xlint:unechecked
   Class.java into the terminal. (However, since it's just a warning, no
   further action is actually necessary.)
2: We can use "import java.util.ArrayList" to utilize the class ArrayList and
   its methods.
3: The add-at-index method previously implemented into our SuperArray classes
   goes against our attempt to impose the invariant that keeps our elements
   of the array in ascending order.
4: We can utilize <> to denote the type that will populate our ordered arrays.
   This can be known as general typing.
5:
QCC:
0. How might our classes look if we tried to perform the methods of ArrayList
   with objects?
1: What defines robust code and how can we make our code look more robust?
